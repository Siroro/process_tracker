# WMI Process Monitor
Overview
The WMI Process Monitor is a Rust application that listens for new process creation events on a Windows machine using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). When a new process is created, it retrieves and displays key information about that process, including its process ID, name, executable path, parent process ID, command line, and creation date.

### Features

* Displays detailed information about each new process.
